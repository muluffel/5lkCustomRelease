### Regarding using BetterVanillaBuilding in our project

Our pack contains some textures that originally come from the BettervanillaBuilding resource pack. 
BetterVanillaBuilding actually only allows the use of textures in private, non-public projects. However, 5lkCustom is a private project and in consultation with the creator of BetterVanillaBuilding, Stefan, we are allowed to use the textures in the public release, as this public release only exists for the server resource pack.
